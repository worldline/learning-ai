# Prompting usages

## Prompt engineering

Prompt engineering involves the design and creation of prompts that are used to elicit specific responses or actions from AI models or interactive systems. These prompts are carefully crafted to guide the behavior or generate particular outputs from the AI, such as generating natural language responses, providing recommendations, or completing specific tasks.

### Definition

In the context of AI language models, prompt engineering is especially important for shaping the model's behavior and output. By designing prompts effectively, engineers can influence the model's responses and ensure that it generates coherent, relevant, and accurate content.

There are four main areas to consider when writing an effective prompt. You don‚Äôt need to use all four, but using a few will help!

- `Persona`: Who is the user you're writing for? What are their skills and knowledge?
- `Task`: What specific action do you want the user to perform?
- `Context`: What information does the user need to know to complete the task?
- `Format`: What is the desired output of the task?

**Example Prompt:**

* [`Persona`] You are a Google Cloud program manager.
* [`Task`] Draft an executive summary email
* [`Context`] to [person description] based on [details about relevant program docs].
* [`Format`] Limit to bullet points.

By using "act as," you are establishing a specific context for the language model and guiding it to understand the type of task or request you are making. This helps to set the right expectations and provides the language model with the necessary context to generate a response tailored to the defined role.

```
"Act as a creative writing assistant and generate a short story based 
on a prompt about a futuristic world where robots have become sentient."
```
## Frameworks

### Framework : Chain of Thought

**Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** encourages models to show their reasoning steps instead of jumping directly to answers.

Introduced in Wei et al. (2022), chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning capabilities through intermediate reasoning steps. You can combine it with few-shot prompting to get better results on more complex tasks that require reasoning before responding.
[Prompting Guide with CoT](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot)


#### ‚ùå Standard Prompting
```
Q: This Python code has a bug. What's wrong?
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)

result = calculate_average([])
```

**Output:** 
```
`ZeroDivisionError`
```

####  ‚úÖ Chain-of-Thought Prompting
```
Q: This Python code has a bug. What's wrong?
[same code]

A: Let me trace through this step by step:
1. Function receives empty list []
2. Loop doesn't execute (no numbers)
3. total remains 0
4. Division: 0 / len([]) = 0 / 0 ‚Üí ZeroDivisionError

Fix: Add empty list check before division.
```

**Output:** 
```
Let me analyze this systematically:
1. **Input**: Empty list []
2. **Loop execution**: No iterations, total = 0  
3. **Division step**: total / len([]) = 0 / 0
4. **Error**: Division by zero

**Solution**: Check if list is empty:
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return 0  # or raise ValueError
    total = sum(numbers)
    return total / len(numbers)
```

#### Key Benefits

| Standard | Chain-of-Thought |
|----------|------------------|
| Direct answer | Shows reasoning steps |
| Hard to debug | Easy to spot errors |
| Less accurate | More reliable |

**Simple trigger**: Add "Let's think step by step" or "Analyze this systematically" to your prompts.



### ReAct ( Reason + Act ) 

**ReAct** combines reasoning (thinking) with acting (tool use) in iterative cycles to solve complex problems step-by-step.

Yao et al., 2022 introduced a framework named ReAct where LLMs are used to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner.

Generating reasoning traces allow the model to induce, track, and update action plans, and even handle exceptions. The action step allows to interface with and gather information from external sources such as knowledge bases or environments.

The ReAct framework can allow LLMs to interact with external tools to retrieve additional information that leads to more reliable and factual responses.

#### ‚ùå Standard Approach
```
Q: What programming language was TikTok's recommendation algorithm originally written in?

A: TikTok's algorithm was written in Python and C++.
```
*May be inaccurate, no verification*

#### ‚úÖ ReAct Approach
```

Thought 1: I need to search for information about TikTok's algorithm implementation.
Act 1: Search[TikTok recommendation algorithm programming language]
Obs 1: TikTok uses machine learning models... but details about specific languages are limited in public sources.

Thought 2: Let me search more specifically for TikTok's technical stack.
Act 2: Search[TikTok backend technology stack programming languages]
Obs 2: TikTok's backend primarily uses Go and Python. ByteDance engineering posts mention Go for microservices.

Thought 3: I should look for official ByteDance engineering information.
Act 3: Search[ByteDance TikTok algorithm Go Python engineering blog]
Obs 3: ByteDance engineering blog confirms Go for backend services, Python for ML pipelines, with some C++ for performance-critical components.

Thought 4: Based on multiple sources, I can provide a comprehensive answer.
Act 4: Finish[TikTok's recommendation system uses primarily Go for backend services, Python for machine learning pipelines, and C++ for performance-critical components] ‚úì

#### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Thought** | Reasoning step | "I need to verify this information" |
| **Act** | Tool usage | Search, Calculate, API call |
| **Observation** | Tool output | Search results, data response |

#### Benefits

- **Verifiable**: Each step can be traced
- **Accurate**: Information is fact-checked
- **Transparent**: Shows the research process
- **Iterative**: Can refine approach based on findings

**Simple pattern**: Think ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Observe ‚Üí Repeat until solution found.
