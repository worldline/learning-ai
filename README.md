# From Generative to Agentic AI for Developers

## Description

This course is designed for developers aiming to harness the capabilities of generative artificial intelligence
 in their software development processes and their application services. It provides a comprehensive overview
 of generative AI, covering its significance, foundational concepts, and practical applications.

The training will explore prompting frameworks to enhance the application lifecycle, engage with essential AI tools
and plugins, and learn to utilize code assistants within integrated development environments (IDEs) for generating
code and complete websites.

It also addresses the management of API calls to large language models (LLMs), the use of context-aware frameworks,
 and the deployment of AI solutions using cloud provider tools such as Google Cloud's Vertex AI and Colab notebooks.

By the end of the course, participants will be equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively integrate
generative AI into their development workflows, fostering innovation and efficiency.
